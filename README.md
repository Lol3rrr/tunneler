# Tunneler
Tunneler is a simple reverse proxy/tunnel application that is meant to be used to get traffic from a public server into your non public server/network.

## Creating a Tunnel
The Tunneler consists of 2 parts, the Server- and Client-Side, so they need to run seperatly.
Both sides also need to know about a key, which can also be generated by the program.

### Generating a key
To easily generate a key that is compatible with this software, which should be any sort of text/byte array but this way
it should also be random enough, you can simply run:

`tunneler key-gen`

The Key-File is assumed to be located at "$HOME/.tunneler/key" by default, this can be changed 
using the command-line option `-k`/`--key` followed by the path.

### Server
This should run on the public side, where all the external requests come in and are then forwarded from here to all
connect clients.

The Server can be started using the command:
`tunneler server`

Command-line Options:
key | Required | Description
--- | --- | ---
-p {ports} | true | The Port(s) on where the Server listens for the actual requests by users
-l {port} | true | The Port on where the Clients connect to
--key {path} | false | The Path from which the Auth-Key is loaded
--threads {count} | false | The Number of threads to use for the Runtime

Port-Options:
Name | Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
Single | 8080 | Will only open one Port(8080) for User-Requests
Multiple | 8080,8081 | Will only allow for the listed ports(8080, 8081) to be opened for User-Requests
Dynamic | .. | Will allow for all requested ports to be opened for User-Requests
Dynamic-Range | 8080..8090 | Will allow for all Ports in the Range to be opened for User-Requests

### Client
This part connects to the Server-Part and forwards all data it receives on individual TCP-Connections to the
specified ip and port

The Client can be started using the command:
`tunneler client`

Command-line Options:
key | Required | Description
--- | --- | ---
--ip {ip} | true | The IP/Address of the external server to which the client should connet to
-l {port} | true | The Port on which the external server listens for clients
-p {port} | true | The External Port on the Server-Instance where the connections will connect to from users
--target-port {port} | true | The Port to which the requests should be forwared to
--target-ip {ip} | true | The IP/Address to which the requests should be forwarded to
--key {path} | false | The Path from which the Auth-Key is loaded
--threads {count} | false | The Number of threads to use for the Runtime
